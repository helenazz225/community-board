## Notes

I had an issue while importing the event component cards into the board component. I was passing props to the event component but I had changed the name of the file after initially importing it, and never updated the file name there. Other than that, I was able to finish the assignment fairly quickly. I spent a lot of time with pushing everything to git since I accidentally tried commiting a gif file that was too large so after getting a smaller gif file, it took me a while to be able to figure out how to push everything.
